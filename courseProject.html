    <h3>CSI 4430: IT Project Management</h3>
    <p>
      I created a Recreation & Wellness Intranet Project Report that applied
      IT Project Management techniques to a real-world case study involving
      the development of a Recreation and Wellness Intranet system. I evaluated
      project alternatives, managed cost and quality, planned resources, and
      assessed risks using structured project management methods.
    </p>

    <h3>CSI 4160: Integrated Computing Systems</h3>
    <p>
      My group and I created a Smart Nutrition Planner. The Smart Nutrition 
      Planner was a serverless web application built for an Integrated Computing 
      Systems course. It used a stateless REST API and an LLM to generate 
      personalized meal plans, enhanced with USDA nutrition 
      data. The system was deployed on AWS using CI/CD pipelines with a focus
      on scalability and privacy. My main role was helping with the documentation and working on Final Presentation slides.

    <h3>CSI 3370: Software Engineering and Practice</h3>
    <p>
      My group and I created a SmartWeather app. The SmartWeather app 
      was a web-based weather application that provided real-time
      weather data, multi-day forecasts, and severe weather alerts using
      third-party APIs. The project emphasized responsive design, scalability,
      and sprint-based software development practices. My main role was working 
      with the UI Design of the app.
    </p>

    <h3>CSI 3450: Database Design & Implementation</h3>
    <p>
      My group and I designed and implemented a MySQL relational database for a professional at-home services application. The project involved developing the database schema, SQL queries, and user interface to ensure the application operated efficiently and reliably. I was primarily responsible for the UI design and for writing and testing database queries to support core application functionality.
