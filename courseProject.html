<h1>Course Project</h1>

<p>CSI 4430: IT Project Management</p>
   <p>I created a Recreational & Wellness Intranet Project Report. This project applied IT Project Management techniques to a real-world case study involving the development of a Recreation and Wellness Intranet system. I evaluated project alternatives, managed cost and quality, planned resources, and assessed risks using structured project management methods.<p> 

<p>CSI 4160: Integrated Computing Systems<p>
    <p>Smart Nutrition Planner was a serverless web app built for an Integrated Computing Systems course. It used a stateless REST API and an LLM to generate personalized meal plans, enhanced with USDA nutrition data, and was deployed on AWS with CI/CD, focusing on scalability and privacy.<p>

<p>CSI 3370: Software Engineering and Practice<p>
    <p>SmartWeather was a web-based weather app built for a Software Engineering course. It provided real-time weather data, multi-day forecasts, and severe weather alerts using third-party APIs, with a focus on responsive design, scalability, and sprint-based development.<p>

<p>CSI 3450: Database Design & Implementation<p>
    <p>My group and I designed and implemented a MySQL relational database for a professional at-home services app, developed the UI design, and created queries to ensure the application functioned properly.<p>
