    <h3>CSI 4430: IT Project Management</h3>
    <p>
      I created a Recreation & Wellness Intranet Project Report that applied
      IT Project Management techniques to a real-world case study involving
      the development of a Recreation and Wellness Intranet system. I evaluated
      project alternatives, managed cost and quality, planned resources, and
      assessed risks using structured project management methods.

    <h3>CSI 4160: Integrated Computing Systems</h3>
    <p>
      Smart Nutrition Planner was a serverless web application built for an
      Integrated Computing Systems course. It used a stateless REST API and
      an LLM to generate personalized meal plans, enhanced with USDA nutrition
      data. The system was deployed on AWS using CI/CD pipelines with a focus
      on scalability and privacy.
    </p>

    <h3>CSI 3370: Software Engineering and Practice</h3>
    <p>
      SmartWeather was a web-based weather application that provided real-time
      weather data, multi-day forecasts, and severe weather alerts using
      third-party APIs. The project emphasized responsive design, scalability,
      and sprint-based software development practices.
    </p>

    <h3>CSI 3450: Database Design & Implementation</h3>
    <p>
      My group and I designed and implemented a MySQL relational database for a
      professional at-home services application. We developed the database
      schema, UI design, and SQL queries to ensure the application functioned
      correctly and efficiently.
